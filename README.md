  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  My programming journey took an unconventional turn when I chose a technical management course for programming in information systems instead of the traditional computer science route. After completing the course, I immersed myself in WordPress and PHP, working on small projects to apply my acquired skills. Transitioning from formal education to practical web development, I spent a year deeply involved in PHP and WordPress. Despite the valuable insights gained, my original dream persisted. I returned to academic studies, pursuing a degree in computer engineering, shifting from practical web development to a more structured approach.
  Concurrently, I embarked on a personal project learning five languages in about four months. This linguistic endeavor, complementing my formal education, represents a deliberate step toward diversifying my skills. With a renewed sense of purpose, I am merging my academic pursuits with the aspiration to master multiple languages, breathing life into my enduring dream.
